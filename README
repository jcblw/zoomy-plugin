#### Zoomy can make life easier on the eyes. ^_^

# New Features
------------

Callbacks, callbacks, callbacks. We have inserted three new callbacks, zoomInit, zoomStart, and zoomEnd. These all stem for the fact that zoomText has been completely removed due to it UI invasiveness and buggy handling. Now to handle some text as if zoomText just use the callbacks to show hide the text. ZoomInit is called when the Zoomy function first fires so if you need to append any elemen to your anchor tag through the zoomInit callback would be the best time. The event handler is complete and pretty solid.

# Upcoming Features
-----------------

### Zoomy Mobile.
=============

Should this be its own project or sense responsive page design is getting popular (because of  HTML 5 Boilerplate), should it be intergrated into zoomy. Let me know your thoughts.

Not really a zoomy feature but is something to do with the community, the zoomy page is going Wiki. I have finally figured out a optimal method for updating the page once it has fully became a wiki. Just cruise over to the pages and add you two sense and if its relevent infomation it can make it to the Zoomy Site. Also Im going to create a section with a place where u can put links to your projects where you use Zoomy.
